# Eloquent ORM


## Preface: Seed data

In this note set we'll explore examples of querying the `books` table in the `foobooks` database, so it'll be useful if we're all working with the same data.

On your local server, in phpMyAdmin, select the `foobooks` database then find the *SQL* tab.

Copy/paste and run the following SQL:

```sql
DELETE FROM books;
INSERT INTO `books` (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `title`, `author`, `published`, `cover`, `purchase_link`) VALUES
(1, '2017-04-13 13:19:36', '2017-04-13 13:19:36', 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 1925, 'http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9780743273565_p0_v4_s114x166.JPG', 'http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-great-gatsby-francis-scott-fitzgerald/1116668135?ean=9780743273565'),

After you run the query, your `books` table should have three rows:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-foobooks-sql-seed-results@2x.png' style='max-width:1126px;' alt=''>

With some data to work with - let's dig in.


## Eloquent ORM
__ORM (Object-relational Mapping)__ is the software practice of using Classes/Objects to represent data entities of an application.

(In all of our work, our *data entities* are database tables/rows, but a data entity could come from other sources, for example some external API that delivers JSON data.)

In Laravel, the ORM system is called __Eloquent__.

If we think ahead with Foobooks, we'll eventually have the following data entities:

+ Books
+ Authors
+ Tags

For each of these entities, we'll have a database table (`books`, `authors`, `tags`) and a corresponding Class (`Book`, `Author`, `Tag`) for interacting with that data.

These Classes used for ORM are referred to as __Models__. Models are the &ldquo;M&rdquo; of the MVC design pattern introduced earlier in the semester.

If you're confused by the various terms used thus far, here's a summary:

| Term  | Definition |
|---|---|
| MVC  | A generic term used to describe a software design pattern where an application is divided into Models, Views, and Controllers.   |
| ORM | A generic term used to describe software that maps Classes/Objects to data.
| Eloquent | The name Laravel uses to describe it's own ORM system.
| Model | A Class/Object used to represent data, i.e. the crux of the concept of ORM.

<br>
Note that only *Eloquent* is unique to Laravel. The other terms are seen in other languages/frameworks. For example, in Ruby on Rails, their ORM tool is called [Active Records](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html), and it was a large inspiration for Laravel's Eloquent.


## Create an Model
Our first Model will be the __Book__ Model, which will interface with the __books__ table.

__Convention__: Model names should be singular, with the first letter capitalized.

Use the following Artisan command to generate a new Model called Book.

```xml
php artisan make:model Book
```

This command will generate a new PHP class file called `Book.php` in your `app/` folder (where Models go by default), and it will contain this boilerplate code:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Book extends Model
{
    //
}
```

Notice how this new class *uses* `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` and extends the `Model` class.
This is what will give the Book class all the functionality provided by Eloquent.


## Eloquent Requirements
In order for Eloquent to work its magic, there are a 3 requirements we should follow:

__Requirement 1) Model's class name convetion__

A Model's class name should be the singular version of the corresponding table name, and it should be capitalized.

So...

| Model  | Table |
|---|---|
| Book | books |
| Author | authors |
| Tag | tags |
<br>

__Requirement 2) Id field__

Tables should have a __Auto Incremented__, __Primary Key__ field named `id`. We discussed the special `id` field when we set up our migrations, so your `books` table already meets this criteria.

__Requirement 3) Timestamps__

Tables should have `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Again, this was something we covered during migrations, so your `books` table should be all set.

<br>
Technically these 3 requirements can be overridden if needed, but we'll avoid straying off convention as much as possible. With this infrastructure in place, you can start to put your Model to work with some queries...




## CRUD - Creating
There's not much going on in our Book Model so far, but that bare minimum is all you need to start interfacing with the database. Just by extending the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` class, you can start taking advantage of the methods provided by Eloquent.

To demonstrate, we'll create an example in the [PracticeController](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-spring2017-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/99_Practice_Work.md) that demonstrates adding a new book using Eloquent's [`save`](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#inserts) method.

Note the addition of `use App\Book;` at the top of the Controller so the Book class is accessible in the Controller's namespace.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Book; # <----------- NEW

class PracticeController extends Controller
{

    public function practiceX() {

        # Instantiate a new Book Model object
        $book = new Book();

        # Set the parameters
        # Note how each parameter corresponds to a field in the table
        $book->title = "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone";
        $book->author = 'J.K. Rowling';
        $book->published = 1997;
        $book->cover = 'http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9780590353427_p0_v1_s484x700.jpg';
        $book->purchase_link = 'http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-j-k-rowling/1100036321?ean=9780590353427';

        # Invoke the Eloquent `save` method to generate a new row in the
        # `books` table, with the above data
        $book->save();

        dump('Added: '.$book->title);
    }

# [...]
```

Study the comments to understand what is going on.


## CRUD - Read
Next, let's look at the Eloquent [`get`](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent#retrieving-models) method to *read* data from a table. We'll also introduce the `where` method to filter the results.

```php
public function practiceX() {

    $book = new Book();
    $books = $book->where('title', 'LIKE', '%Harry Potter%')->get();

    if($books->isEmpty()) {
        dump('No matches found');
    }
    else {
        foreach($books as $book) {
            dump($book->title);
        }
    }
}
```


## Facade vs. Instantiated Models
In the above examples, a new Book object was explicitly instantiated before the query:

```php
$book  = new Book(); # Instantiate new book object
$books = $book->where('title', 'LIKE', '%Harry Potter%')->get(); # Query
```

This can be abbreviated using the Model as a [facade](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-spring2017-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/10_Facades.md), e.g.:

```php
$books = Book::where('title', 'LIKE', '%Harry Potter%')->get();
```

You'll see both styles in examples and documentation.



## Query Structure
Now that we've seen two examples, let's dig deeper into the structure of Eloquent queries.

An Eloquent query is made up of...

1. __constraint method(s)__ (optional) to filter the query
2. __fetch method__ to run the query and determine what results to get back

<br>
Constraint methods should always come before fetch methods.

<br>
<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-eloquent-constraint-fetch@2x.png' style='max-width:865px;' alt=''>
<br>

Here are examples showing a combination of constraint and fetch methods:


### Example A.
```php
# Get only books published after 1950
#   `where` is the constraint method
#   `get` is the fetch method
$results = Book::where('published', '>', 1950)->get();
dump($results->toArray()); # Study the results
```

### Example B.
```php
# Get only books that were authored by F. Scott Fitzgerald
    # `where` is the constraint method
    # `get` is the fetch method
$results = Book::where('author', '=', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald')->get();
dump($results->toArray()); # Study the results
```

### Example C.
```php
# Get the *first* book in the table that was authored by F. Scott Fitzgerald
    # `where` & `orderBy` are the constraint methods
    # `first` is the fetch method
$results = Book::where('author', '=', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald')->orderBy('created_at')->first();
dump($results->toArray()); # Study the results
```

### Example D.
```php
# Get only books that were published after 1950 *and* authored by F. Scott Fitzgerald
    # `where` is the constraint method, and it's used twice
    # `get` is the fetch method
$results = Book::where('published', '>', 1950)->where('author', '=', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald')->get();
dump($results->toArray()); # Study the results
```

### Example E.
```php
# Get all the books
    # There is no constraint method
    # `all` is the fetch method
$results = Book::all();
dump($results->toArray()); # Study the results
```

With more information about query structure behind us, let's look at some examples of updating and deleting data.


## CRUD - Updating
To update a row in a table, you first have to select which row(s) you wish to edit. Then you can alter the properties of the row and then save those changes using the `save` method.

```php
# First get a book to update
$book = Book::where('author', 'LIKE', '%Scott%')->first();

if(!$book) {
    dump("Book not found, can't update.");
}
else {

    # Change some properties
    $book->title = 'The Really Great Gatsby';
    $book->published = '2025';

    # Save the changes
    $book->save();

    dump('Update complete; check the database to confirm the update worked.');
}    
```



## CRUD - Deleting
Similar to updating, when deleting a book, you have to first find the book you want to delete.

```php
# First get a book to delete
$book = Book::where('author', 'LIKE', '%Scott%')->first();

if(!$book) {
    dump('Did not delete- Book not found.');
}
else {
    $book->delete();
    dump('Deletion complete; check the database to see if it worked...');
}
```


## Resources & Practice

The combinations of constraints and fetch methods you can use are practically limitless, and building complex queries is almost an art-form.

To get good at writing queries it takes practice.

+ Start by bookmarking and studying __[these example queries...](http://github.com)__

+ Skim the
[API Docs on query methods](https://laravel.com/api/5.4/Illuminate/Database/Query/Builder.html) to see *all* the methods available to you.

+ And, of course, refer to the [Laravel Eloquent Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).

<br>
Armed with this information, write queries to accomplish the following...

+ Retrieve the last 5 books that were added to the `books` table.
+ Retrieve all the books published after 1950.
+ Retrieve all the books in alphabetical order by title.
+ Retrieve all the books in descending order according to published date.
+ Find any books by the author `Bell Hooks` and update the author name to be `bell hooks` (lowercase).
+ Remove any books by the author &ldquo;J.K. Rowling&rdquo;.

<br>
Bonus practice: This code...

```php
$book = new Book();
$book->title = "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone";
$book->save();
```

...would produce this error:
```xml
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'published' doesn't have a default value (SQL: insert into `books` (`title`, `updated_at`, `created_at`) values (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, 2017-04-13 08:19:57, 2017-04-13 08:19:57))
```

Why?

<br>(Solutions to these exercises will be shared next lecture)

## Another look at ORM
Now that we've seen Eloquent Models in action, let's revisit the definition of ORM.

As stated above, ORM (__Object-relational Mapping__) is the software practice of using objects to represent data entities in your application.

In our setup, our objects are called Models.

The Models represent data entities in our application (Book, Author, User, etc.)

There is a mapping of the object's properties to fields in the database tables.

We saw this when we did something like `$book->title`. The object was `$book`, the property was `title`. This *maps* to a table called `books` with a field called `title`.

Here's a big picture visualizing the relationship between the Class, Object, and table.
